# HTTP API

## Definition

* **Resource** - An important thingy you want to expose through your API
* **URI** - a name for a resource (Uniform Resource Identifier)
* **METHOD** - Resources have a fixed set of methods. You can't make them up. See below.
* **Representation** - A projection of the state of a resource at a particular point in time.
* **Media Type** - A specific format for a representation, like `application/json`, `text/html`, etc.


## Http Resources
Two basic categories.

* Document - Represents a specific instance of a resource. e.g. `/customers/bob-smith`
* Collection - Represents a group of related resources. e.g. `/customers`

Documents are usually *subordinate* resources to a collection, but documents can also have subordinate resources that are either documents or collections.

Examples:

`/customers/bob-smith/address` - the address data for Bob Smith. `/customers/bob-smith/sales-rep` - Bob's sales representative (could be an alias to `/employees/jill-jones`)

Collection resources can be filtered using a query string argument:

`GET /customers` - returns all customers
`GET /customers?state=KY` - returns just the customers in Kentucky

## Http Methods

| Method | Description | Resource Type | Example |Safe| Idempotent | Cacheable |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|GET|Retreive a representation|Document|GET|/customers/bob-smith|True|True|True|
|GET|Retreive a representation|Collection|GET|/customers/|True|True|True|
|POST|Submit an Entity For Processing|Document|POST|/customers/bob-smith/credit|False|False|False|
|POST|Consider Adding this as a subordinate resource|Collection|POST|/customers|False|False|False*|
|PUT|Replace (or upsert) this document|Document|PUT|/customers/bob-smith/email-address|False|True|False|
|PUT|Replace this collection|Collection|PUT|/customers|False|True|False|
|DELETE|Remove this document|Document|DELETE|/customers/bob-smith/|False|True|False|
|DELETE|Remove this collection|Collection|DELETE|/customers/|False|True|False|

:::note NOTE
Rarely do you support `DELETE` or `PUT` on a collection, and rarely do you support `POST` on a document

## Properties
* **Safe** - means there are no "side effects" - nothing about the business changes because of this operation.
* **Idempotent** - Doing it multiple times has the same effect as doing it once.
* **Cacheable** - Responses from this operation should have cache headers indicating their reuse constraints.
