# Programming Modalities
:::tip TIP
This is a simplified categorization of the multitude of ways you might be working as a developer
:::

*The differentiator between these is how focused is your work on requirements that the average business person would correlate with the requirements of the business, vs. technical requirements. *

## Systems Programmer
Creating operating systems, databases, "stateful services", all that jazz. Low level - C++, Rust, Go

## Framework or Library Programmer
- Framework - code that uses your code.
- Library - code that your code uses.

## Application Developer
Our work and our job is to:

- Make the company more money
- Reduce liability

"Application" means to "apply" technology to solve a business requirement.

* We write the code for understandability over worrying about performance, etc.
